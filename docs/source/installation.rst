Installation
============

Section 1: Installation
-----------------------

The users can install the **UniFoil interface** by cloning the repository from the following link:  
`<Insert Repository Link Here>`_

Once inside the cloned repository, run the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install .

This command will install the **UniFoil interface** along with all of its dependencies.

.. warning::

   This installation process will also install all dependencies such as
   ``numpy`` and ``niceplots``. These packages may upgrade versions of existing
   libraries you already have installed locally.  
   If this could cause conflicts, it is strongly recommended to create a
   `Python virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_
   before installing **UniFoil**.
