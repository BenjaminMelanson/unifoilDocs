To test the UniFoil Dataset, a set of scripts were used to access the dataset and use the information for training a Machine Learning Algorithm.
This algorithm was trained in TensorFlow on the Turbulent Airfoil Data.
This section will include the documentation for this work and should serve as a starting point for ML Research.
