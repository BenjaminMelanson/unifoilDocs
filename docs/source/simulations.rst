Simulations

UniFoil used ADFlow and the MACH-Aero library to simulate the data.
In the event that the data provided in our lab is insufficent for your needs, we have also included scripts to help generate more samples.
You can customise the generation arguments to gather simulations with specific properties.
It is important to note that ADFlow and its dependances are optimized for CPU work and not GPUs.
It is recommended to use a high power CPU Cluster if available to speed up processing.
